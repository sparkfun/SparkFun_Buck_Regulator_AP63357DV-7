	Please handle these boards with the utmost caution. Users can easily burn themselves when the board outputs anything over 2A.

## Maximum Current
While the AP6337 is rated up to 3.5A, users may experience thermal limitations towards that maximum.

* Users should reasonably expect to be able to place a maximum 3A load on the boards when using a heat sink and active cooling. 
* At the peak load of 3.5A, users will need sufficient cooling to prevent the IC's [thermal shutdown](#thermal-characteristics "The AP63357 has a 170&deg;C (338&deg;F) thermal shutdown temperature.").

!!! note
    * Without a heat sink or active cooling, we recommend users not load the boards with more than 1.5A.
    * With a heat sink, we have found users can expect to draw up to 2.5A
